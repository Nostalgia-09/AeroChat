!! FOR WINDOWS 8.1/8/7/VISTA USERS !!

If you're using a Windows build older than Windows 10 1809, please read! You'll need to install a patch. Below are the instructions:

1. Download the patch at https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1173646485330612394/1193832588914204672/aerochat-1809-fix.zip
2. Install the program, and when it errors out on launch just press "OK"
3. Extract the patch, and copy the contents into the installation directory (typically %localappdata%\Programs\aerochat)
4. Allow it to merge folders, replace files, whatever. If it doesn't replace any files, then you've not copied it properly.
5. Run the program.

NOTE: Voice chat does not work before Windows 10 1809.
